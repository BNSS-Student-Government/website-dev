# Website currently live at [bnsgov.ca](bnsgov.ca)

Made with React

Contrary to the repo name, this is **NOT A DEVELOPMENT REPOSITORY!** 

Make a fork as all changes are automatically deployed to production by Vercel.


## Are you a future Gov member who needs to update the website?

## Setup & Development
### Codespaces
Create a new codespace. 
Note that the actual node project is in /website-dev (you'll have to run `cd website-dev`).
Run `npm run start` to start development! Open the forwarded port; the page will reload as you make changes.

### On Device
Just do everything but locally. Make sure node is installed; site will be at http://localhost:3000/
